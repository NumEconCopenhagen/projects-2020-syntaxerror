# Inaugural project

In this project we want to solve a consumer maximization problem. We are solveing a lobour supply problem, and finding the optimal values of different types of taxes. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Finalinauguralversion.ipynb](Finalinauguralversion.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
