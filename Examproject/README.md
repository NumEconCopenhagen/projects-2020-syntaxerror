# Exam project

Our project is titled **examproject_2020** and have three different sections - Linear regression, Durable purchases and Gradient descent. 

Linear regression: We estimatet the vector of coefficients in three different ways - matrix algebra, numerical solver and least absolute deviations. Furthermore we plotted our linear regression, and estimated the two different solvers.

Durable purchases: We found and plotted the different functions in the problem for households.

Gradient descent: We implemented an algorithm to find the minimum of a function by using a loop.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [examp_2020.ipynb](examproject_2020.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
