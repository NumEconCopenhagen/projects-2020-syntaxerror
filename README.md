This portfolio is a collection of 3 projects and 1 exam project.

Project (0) - Inaugural Project: Solve and optimize a simple economic model of labour supply. In this project we learned the basics of creating an optimizer to solve economic problems.

Project (1) - Data Project: In this project we choose to analyze armed conflict around the world. In this project we learned to fetch data and gradually clean it to a prefered finalized table.

Project (2) - Model Project: In this project we choose to solve Keynesian cross and the IS-LM model. We examine how big of an effect changes in public expenditure, and changes in taxes in the economy under different circumstances. In this project we learned to calculate and display economic models and how to use the optimizers available.

## The Exam Project
Linear regression: We estimatet the vector of coefficients in three different ways - matrix algebra,  numerical solver and  least absolute deviations. Furthermore we plotted our linear regression, and estimated the two different solvers.

Durable purchases: We found and plotted the different functions in the problem for households. 

Gradient descent: We implemented an algorithm to find the minimum of a function by using a loop.
