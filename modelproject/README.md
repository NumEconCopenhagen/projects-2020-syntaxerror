# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **ModelProjectKeynes** and is about the keyniesian cross, and how government purchases and a drop in taxes effects the production differently. This is shown mathematically and graphically. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [ModelProjectKeynes.ipynb](ModelProjectKeynes.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
