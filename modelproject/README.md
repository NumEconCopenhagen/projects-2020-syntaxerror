# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **ModelProjectKeynesISLM** and is about the keyniesian cross and the IS-LM model. We examine how government purchases and a drop in taxes effects the production differently, and how lump sum and a proportional income tax have different effect on output. This is shown mathematically and graphically. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [ModelprojectKeynesISLM-2.ipynb](ModelprojectKeynesISLM-2.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
